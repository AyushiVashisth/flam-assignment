<h2 align="center">Project Structure:</h2>

Key Features:

React-Based: The project is built using the React JavaScript library, a popular choice for building user interfaces. React allows for efficient component-based development, making it easier to manage and update the application's UI.

Dynamic Bottom Sheet: The main feature of this project is the dynamic bottom sheet. Users can interact with the application to open the bottom sheet in three different sizes: small, half-screen, and full-screen. This dynamic behavior enhances user engagement and flexibility.

React Spring Integration: React Spring is integrated into the project to handle animations and transitions. It ensures that the opening and closing of the bottom sheet are smooth and visually appealing. React Spring's animation capabilities are used to create a polished user interface.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it functions well on various screen sizes and devices. Media queries and CSS styles adapt the layout and content for smaller screens.

Customizable Content: The content displayed in the bottom sheet is customizable. Users can replace the default content with their own information, making it versatile for different use cases.

Project Structure:

App.js: The main application component that manages the state of the bottom sheet (height) and renders buttons to control its size.

ButtomSheet.js: A component responsible for rendering the bottom sheet interface. It receives the height as a prop and displays customizable content.

BottomSheet.css: Contains the styles for the bottom sheet and its components, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent design.
